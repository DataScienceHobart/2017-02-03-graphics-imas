If you want to try R code while we discuss, recommend having `R 3.3.2` installed with packages below. 

To install all these, you should need only to 

```R
install.packages(c("leaflet", "sp", "rgdal", "tidyverse", "maptools", "rworldmap", "mapview"))
```

but if you have problems, don't worry it's not critical. (But feel free to email the organizer/s. )
